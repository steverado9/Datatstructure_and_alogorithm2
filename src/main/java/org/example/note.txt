Data is everything.
No metter the technology you are learning, you are learning it to work with data.
We use programming language to process data
We use database to store data
   What is data structure?
This is a way to organise and store data efficiently.
   When we say efficiently?
we are talking in terms of performance and Memory.
    What are algorithms
Set of instructions to perform a particular task.
    pseudocode
instructions/steps, and they can work on any language.
    Types of data structure
we have different types of data structure , but we need to understand when to use what.
That is use a proper algorithm with a proper data structure.
    Data
A variable is used to store data. and the variable will have a type.
Data types: the type of data a variable is storing/holding. and they are usually system defined data types called primitive data types.
complex data types eg class: This is a user defined data type.
    Abstract data type
This is when you have a concept and operations to it and it has data in it.
Meaning we can create our own data types and operations it can take.
    Arrays
Instead of storing different values in different variables,
We can store all the values in a single variable called "Array".
eg
int[] numbers = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
This data will be stored in a memory
And every memory will have a memory location
for primitive data,
anytime we need the data, the program will jump to the memory location by searching for the address to get it.
but for arrays,
once the first element is stored in, it takes an index of 0. To get the rest element, you just have to add 1 to it.
    Operations on an array
1)Read operation: we use the arrayname[index], the computer will just to the memory address.
This is a fast operation cos the computer already knows the memory location of the array and it uses the index to get the data.
2)Search operation: In searching, we are not using the index and the computer doesnt know where the element is without the index.
So we basically have to search each element.
3)Insert operation: inserting at the end, We have to get the size of the array and add to +1 of the index.
Inserting in between values: we have to create a new block at the end of the array and start moving the elements one by one till there is space to add inbetween.
4)Deleting operation: deleting at the end is also faster.
deleting in between will take alot of time cos you have to move the elements one by one and that depends on the number of elements in the array.
    Time complexity
The number of steps your code takes to perform the operation determines the time complexity.
A good algorithm should be time efficient.
The steps to solve a problem is called algorithm.
To solve a problem, we have multiple solutions, but we have to pick the best one.
The best one is the one that is less time-consuming.
